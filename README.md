_**Safe at Home, Stay at Farm!**_

## Inspiration
Inspired by the Forest app that plants trees when you stay focused and stay away from your phone, the Stay At Farm Everybody! app rewards its users when they stay at home to avoid the spread of COVID-19.

## What it does
The app simply checks for the user's location and sees how long they have been staying in one location. The overall style is designed to be an animal farm. The longer one stays in one location, the greater variety of animal collections they get in their farm!

## How we built it
We built this app using Android Studio, with the languages Java and XML as well as the APIs of Radar.io and Firebase.

# Demonstration
We have recorded a [video demonstration](https://youtu.be/oFd7BHKHBiY) of the app running on an actual Android device.

When you open the app, you can see directly the game interface, which is an empty animal farm!
As soon as you open the app, it will track how long you stay at your current location 
(which also works while the app runs in the background). The longer you stay at one location, as you practice social 
distancing to fight against COVID-19, the more animals will appear in your animal farm. Yay! 
  
On the top left corner of the game screen, you have the instructions button which will show our inspiration for building the 
app as well as a guide for how to play the game. On the top right corner of the screen is the settings button where you can 
adjust settings for location and sound.
